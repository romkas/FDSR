### FDSR
Flow, Deepen, Segment, Reconstruct

An implementation of image segmentation algorithms based on graph clustering, and the execution and testing framework.

The problem considers the detection of plane image regions. It involves the following:
1. superpixel clustering;
1. approximating clusters with hyperplane models in coordinate-depth image space;
1. the use of hierarchical clustering to merge clusters with similar models.
